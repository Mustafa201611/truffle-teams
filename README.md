# Truffle Teams<sup> beta</sup>

## Overview

Truffle Teams<sup> **beta**</sup> is a new service from TruffleSuite!

Our initial offering is a (free) __zero config__ continuous integration service designed explicitly for your truffle projects!  We've added some natural chocolate polish too, of course :chocolate_bar:

Seamlessly attach your Truffle project to Truffle Teams<sup> **beta**</sup> using GitHub and we'll handle running your automated tests with every commit. It's like Travis CI, but with no additional work by you! You can get started at https://truffleframework.com/teams.

## Getting Started

1. Visit [Truffle Teams](https://my.truffleteams.com/)<sup> **beta**</sup> to sign up with GitHub. You will be automatically redirected to your [dashboard](https://my.truffleteams.com).
2. On your [dashboard](https://my.truffleteams.com), you will be prompted to "Add a repository". This will initiate the installation of Truffle Teams<sup> **beta**</sup> on one or more GitHub repositories.
3. Commit to any truffle project you've added to Truffle Teams<sup> **beta**</sup>! We'll automatically run all of your truffle tests!
