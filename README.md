# Truffle Teams<sup>beta</sup>

## Overview

Truffle Teams<sup>beta</sup> is a new offering from TruffleSuite.

Our initial offering is a (free) __zero config__ continuous integration service designed explicitly for your truffle projects!  We've added some natural chocolate polish too, of course :chocolate_bar:

Seamlessly attach your truffle project to Truffle Teams<sup>beta</sup> using Github and we'll handle running your automated tests with every commit. It's like Travis CI, but with no additional work by you! You can get started at https://truffleframework.com/teams.
